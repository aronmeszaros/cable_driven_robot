roslaunch br_driver br_driver.launch robot_ip:=127.0.0.1 port:=50001 # launches the sim robot
rosrun br_driver robot_simulator 127.0.0.1 50001

Then we should launch tf_estim which 


rosrun br_driver tf_estim # Estimates the Cartesian position

rosrun br_driver tf_with_joint_gui.py  # Allows to set a desired joint position and/or tf transform
									   # Also displays current motor position and estimated platform position					

# I need another file that takes desired platform location and creates a trajectory of waypoints 

I will modify trajectory controller to do that
